# Name that Planet Trivia Game

### Overview
This game was built using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery for DOM manipulation.

* The game will show one question at a time.

* If the player guesses correctly, an image of the correct planet they guessed will appear congratulating them. Regardless of whether or not the player answers, a timer is put in to move on to the next question.

 * If the player chooses incorrectly, they get the image of a black hole telling them they guessed wrong.

* On the final screen, the number of guesses is totaled and they have the option of playing again!
